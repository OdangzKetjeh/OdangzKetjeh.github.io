            [00:08.37]You walked into the room
[00:11.14]And now my heart has been stolen
[00:16.90]You took me back in time to when I was unbroken
[00:24.43]Now you're all I want
[00:26.94]And I knew it from the very first moment
[00:32.94]'Cause a light came on when I heard that song
[00:38.19]And I want you to sing it again
[00:43.70]I swear that every word you sing
[00:47.46]You wrote them for me
[00:52.22]Like it was a private show
[00:55.47]But I know you never saw me
[00:59.98]When the lights come on and I'm on my own
[01:04.49]Will you be there to sing it again?
[01:10.49]Could I be the one you talk about in all your stories?
[01:17.26]Can I be him?
[01:21.77]I heard there was someone but I know he don't deserve you
[01:29.27]If you were mine I'd never let anyone hurt you no no
[01:37.79]I wanna dry those tears, kiss those lips

[02:45.14]Oh, can I, can I be him?
[02:50.15]Won't you sing it again
[02:53.91]Oh, when you sing it again
[02:57.17]Can I be him
